# Ryerson University - CKME136 Capstone Project
## Image Descriptions

### Purpose
I completed this capstone project as the final assignment for the Data Analytics program at Ryerson University

### Goal
By using the data set, I want to create a classification algorithm that would predict the best word and image combination.

### Data Set Directory
The data set was extracted from the website http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone. Data set is no longer on the current website. This data set can also be download from the website https://data.world/crowdflower/image-descriptions.
