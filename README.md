# Ryerson University - CKME136 Capstone Project
## Image Descriptions

### Purpose
This capstone project was my final assignment for completing the Data Analytics program at Ryerson University.

### Objective
I plan on using this data set to create a classification algorithm that would predict the best word and image combinations.

### Data 
The data set was extracted from the [website](https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/). Data set is no longer on the current website. This data set can also be download from the [website](https://data.world/crowdflower/image-descriptions). 

### Wiki
Please refer to the wiki for a detailed breakdown of my project.
