### Purpose
This capstone project was my final assignment for completing the Data Analytics program at Ryerson University.

### Objective
I plan to use this dataset to create a classification algorithm that would predict the best word and image combinations.

### Data 
I extracted the dataset from [Figure Eight's Website](https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/). Unfortunately, the dataset is no longer on the original website. The dataset is still available on [Data.World's Website](https://data.world/crowdflower/image-descriptions). 

### Wiki
Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/davidlamcanada/Ryerson-CKME136/wiki) for a detailed breakdown of my project.
