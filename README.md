# Ryerson University - CKME136 Capstone Project
## Image Descriptions

### Purpose
I completed this capstone project as the final assignment for the Data Analytics program at Ryerson University

### Goal
By using the dataset, I want to create a classification algorithm that would predict the best word and image combination.

### Dataset
The dataset was extracted from the website http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone. Dataset is no longer on the current website. This dataset can also be download from the website https://data.world/crowdflower/image-descriptions.
